Chinese Remainder Theorem. System x ≡ ai (mod mi) for i = 1, . . . , n, with pairwise relativelyprime mi has a unique solution modulo M = m1m2 . . . mn: x = a1b1 M m1 + · · · + anbn M mn (mod M), where bi is modular inverse of M mi modulo mi . System x ≡ a (mod m), x ≡ b (mod n) has solutions iff a ≡ b (mod g), where g = gcd(m, n). The solution is unique modulo L = mn g , and equals: x ≡ a + T(b − a)m/g ≡ b + S(a − b)n/g (mod L), where S and T are integer solutions of mT + nS = gcd(m, n).
